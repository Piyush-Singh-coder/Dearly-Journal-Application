## 🛠 Technology Stack

Dearly leverages a modern, decoupled architecture splitting a lightweight JavaScript API from a highly reactive Single Page Application.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React 18 (Vite)
- **State Management:** Zustand (for global application state), React Router DOM (for client-side routing)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for fluid animations and layout transitions), Lucide React (for iconography)
- **Editor Engine:** Tiptap (Headless, prose-mirror based WYSIWYG editor integration with Yjs extensions)
- **Real-time Sync:** Yjs (for client-side CRDT state resolution), y-websocket

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database ORM:** Prisma
- **Database Engine:** PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Authentication & Storage:** Supabase Auth (JWT-based), Supabase Storage (S3-compatible bucket for media/audio)
- **Real-time Server:** Hocuspocus (A robust, highly scalable Node.js extension for Yjs WebSocket connections)
- **Security & Utils:** bcryptjs (hashing), crypto, Nodemailer (for transactional emails)

## ⚙️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL Database URL
- Supabase Project (for Authentication, Storage, and PostgreSQL hosting)
- Resend or SMTP Provider (for email services)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piyush-Singh-coder/Dearly-Journal-Application.git
cd Dearly-Journal-Application
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
```env
PORT=3000

# Prisma Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# JWT Config
JWT_SECRET="your_secure_jwt_secret"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

# Supabase Credentials (from Project API Settings)
SUPABASE_URL="https://[PROJECT_ID].supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="..."

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.example.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER="..."
EMAIL_PASS="..."
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
```

Push the database schema and generate the Prisma Client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

*(Optional)* Seed the database with demo content:
```bash
node scripts/seed.js
```

Start the local API and WebSocket server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal session, navigate to the frontend directory, and install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key_here"
```

Start the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
